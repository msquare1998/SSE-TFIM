# SSE-TFIM
Stochastic series expansion (quantum Monte Carlo) algorithm for the 1D transverse field Ising model written in C++17.

Attention that the Hamiltonian has shifted by some constant in the simulation. Then if you compare it with exact diagonalization, you should take the shift in to account.
